# MVC (Mini Lab)

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will implement the MVC map, trying to *grasp* the **concept of MVC** as much as possible before moving on to **Flask**!

## Review:

0. Pair up with a partner, and draw the layout of an **MVC Map**!
    - It can be done using a paper and pen.  

## Exploring MVC

1. Startup idea: A youtube, but just for cat videos: cattube.com. We want to keep this website simple, so users should be able to do two things: upload a new cat video and display all of the published cat videos in order.

    - Split up cattube according to MVC. What information belongs to each component?
       

##### Great job! Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks!




## Bonus tasks!

2. Discussion question: 

    (a) What are some advantages of MVC? 
    
    (b) What are some disadvantages of MVC? 
    
3. Put on your MVC glasses: Can you come up with other MVC examples? Which parts correspond to which letter? (Crazier examples are better; you can analyze pretty much anything with the MVC mindset!!)
